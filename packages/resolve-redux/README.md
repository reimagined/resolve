### `createViewModelsReducer`

  Generates a [Redux reducer](https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers) from reSolve View Models. Arguments:

```js
createViewModelsReducer(viewModels)
```

### `createReadModelsReducer`

  Generates a [Redux reducer](https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers) using reSolve Read Models. Arguments:

```js
createReadModelsReducer(readModels)
```

### `createJwtReducer`

  Generates a [Redux reducer](https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers) using a reSolve JWT. No arguments:

```js
createJwtReducer()
```

### `createResolveMiddleware`
  
  Redux middleware is used to:

  1. Fetch View and Read Models 
  2. Subscribe to events
  3. Send commands to the server side
  
```js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware, combineReducers } from 'redux'
import { routerReducer, routerMiddleware } from 'react-router-redux'
import {
  createViewModelsReducer,
  createReadModelsReducer,
  createJwtReducer,
  createResolveMiddleware
} from 'resolve-redux'

const resolveMiddleware = createResolveMiddleware()

const store = createStore(
  combineReducers({
    ...reducers,
    router: routerReducer,
    viewModels: createViewModelsReducer(viewModels),
    readModels: createReadModelsReducer(readModels),
    jwt: createJwtReducer()
  }),
  initialState,
  applyMiddleware(
    routerMiddleware(history),
    resolveMiddleware,
    ...middlewares
  )
)

resolveMiddleware.run({
  store,
  viewModels,
  readModels,
  aggregates,
  origin,
  rootPath,
  subscribeAdapter,
  sessionId,
  isClient
})
```

### `connectViewModel`
  A higher-order component (HOC), used to automatically subscribe/unsubscribe to/from View Model updates, and access the aggregate commands by `aggregateIds`.

```js
import { connect } from 'react-redux'
import { connectViewModel } from 'resolve-redux'
import { bindActionCreators } from 'redux'

const MyComponent = () => { /* React component implementation */ }

const mapStateToOptions = (state, ownProps) => ({
  viewModelName,
  aggregateIds
})

const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({
  items: ownProps.data
})

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) =>
  bindActionCreators(aggregateActions, dispatch)

export default connectViewModel(mapStateToOptions)(
  connect(
    mapStateToProps,
    mapDispatchToProps
  )(MyComponent)
)
```

### `connectReadModel`
  A higher-order component (HOC), used to automatically subscribe/unsubscribe to/from Read Model updates, and access the corresponding aggregate's commands.

```js
import { connect } from 'react-redux'
import { connectReadModel } from 'resolve-redux'
import { bindActionCreators } from 'redux'

const MyComponent = () => { /* React component implementation */ }

const mapStateToOptions = (state, ownProps) => {
  return {
    readModelName: 'Items',
    resolverName: 'getAllItems',
    resolverArgs: {  },
    isReactive: true
  }
}

const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => {
  return {
    items: ownProps.data,
  }
}

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) =>
  bindActionCreators(aggregateActions, dispatch)

export default connectReadModel(mapStateToOptions)(
  connect(
    mapStateToProps,
    mapDispatchToProps
  )(MyComponent)
)
```

### `createActions`
