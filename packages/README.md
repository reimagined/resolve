# **reSolve Packages**

The reSolve framework includes the following packages:

* [**reSolve Packages**](#resolve-packages)
    The base framework elements. We don't expect contributions into these packages, because this may affect the whole framework.

* [**Adapter Packages**](adapters/)
    The adapters for different framework elements, such as Storage Adapters, Bus Adapters, etc. The contributions to these packages are highly welcome. Refer the [Contributing.md](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/Contributing.md) file before sending a Pull Request.
