# **reSolve Packages**
The reSolve framework includes the following packages:

* [**Core packages**](core/)
    They are in charge of base framework parts, such as an app creation and common features. This folder isn't supposed to be extended by our contributors, because those packages impact all framework functioning.

* [**Adapters packages**](adapters/)
    They are intended for importing adapters for different framework parts, such as storages or bus read-models. This folder could be extended by contributors packages that are followed the [contributing file](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/Contributing.md).
