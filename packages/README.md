# **reSolve Packages**

The reSolve framework includes the following packages:

* [**Core Packages**](core/)
    The base framework elements. We don't expect third-party contributions into these packages because they may affect the framework as a whole.

    The adapters for different framework elements, such as Storage Adapters, Read Model Adapters, etc. The contributions to these packages are highly welcomed. Please, see the [Contributing.md](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/Contributing.md) file before you submit a Pull Request.
    
* [**Module Packages**](adapters/)
