A **Read Model Adapter** for [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database.
The adapter provides a query API for projection and resolvers. This API is standard among reSolve read model adapters, so you can change a **Read Model Adapter** in the configuration file without changing the code.

## Available Parameters

- `databaseFile` - the database's location in file system, or `:memory:` for temporary in-memory storage.

The adapter interface is defined in the **@resolve-js/readmodel-base** package.
