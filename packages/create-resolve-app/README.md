# **🚀 Create ReSolve App** [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/create-resolve-app.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/create-resolve-app)
This package creates an application based on the reSolve framework. Your can use `--sample` option if need a single page application (SPA) which represents a typical Todo List. The application is built on the CQRS and Event Sourcing principles using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) + [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) on the client.

Create ReSolve App allows you to specify application blocks (aggregates, read models, and UI part React components present) in a semi-declarative manner. With the `resolve-scripts` package, you do not need to write an API backend manually. Instead, `resolve-scripts` deploys backend and domain services to interact with the client which is wrapped in the `resolve-redux` package for an automated interaction.

## **🔎 Quick Overview**
> Note: Installing a package globally may require administrative privileges. This means you have to use the sudo command for Unix-based systems or run a terminal with administrative privileges on Windows systems.

```bash

```
![Terminal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15689049/29822549-8513584c-8cd4-11e7-8b65-b88fdad7e4d1.png)
Your app will be opened in the browser at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

## **▶️ Getting Started**
### 🏗 Create an App
Create a new reSolve application in one of the following ways:

using yarn...  
```bash
yarn create resolve-app my-resolve-app
```
...or npx:  
```bash
npx create-resolve-app my-resolve-app
```
...or npm:  
```bash
npm i -g create-resolve-app
create-resolve-app my-resolve-app
```
This creates the `my-resolve-app` directory in the current folder and generates the initial project structure in that directory:
```
resolve-app/
  .babelrc
  .eslintrc
  .flowconfig
  .gitignore
  .travis.yml
  LICENSE
  README.md
  package-lock.json
  package.json
  resolve.build.config.js
  resolve.client.config.js
  resolve.server.config.js
  client/
    actions/
    components/
    containers/
    reducers/
  common/
    aggregates/
    read-models/
    store/

  tests/
```
### 📋 Available Scripts
Once the installation is completed, you can run the following commands in the project directory to start your app:

### `npm run dev`
Runs the app in the development mode.

Two web servers are  started: one - for the frontend/UI part, based on the webpack-dev-server on port 3001 by default, and another one - for the API backend part to provide the API for reSolve endpoints, based on express on port 3000. Development servers provide all the required debugging capabilities, including [Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/) and [source maps](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/).

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to view the app in the browser.

### `npm run build`
Builds client and server bundles for production through Webpack.

Building is performed in the `NODE_ENV === 'production'` [mode](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/#node-environment-variable), so the build is optimized. No additional HTTP server for the serving client bundle and assets are  built.

### `npm start`
Runs the built app in the production mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to view it in the browser.
