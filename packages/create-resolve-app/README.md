# **Create reSolve App** ðŸš€
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/create-resolve-app.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/create-resolve-app)

This package creates an empty application based on the reSolve framework ([`hello-world` example](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/tree/master/examples/hello-world)). Use the `--example` option to create another sample application. reSolve applications are built on the CQRS and Event Sourcing principles and use [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) + [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) on the client side.

**Create reSolve App** allows you to specify application blocks (aggregates, read models, and UI elements (React components)) in a semi-declarative manner. The `resolve-scripts` package deploys API backend and domain services to interact with the client. The `resolve-redux` package automates the client-server interaction.

Refer to the [React/Redux Links](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links) document for details on subject-related technologies and links to the corresponding resources.

* [Getting Started](#getting-started) - How to create a new app
* [User Guide](#user-guide) - Information on apps created with the Create reSolve App

Available options:

- `--example <folder>` - creates an application from [examples](../../examples). The default example is [`hello-world`](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/tree/master/examples/hello-world).
- `--branch <branch>` or `--commit <sha>` - use the example code from the specific branch or commit.
- `--version` or `-V` - show the version number.

## **Quick Overview** ðŸ”Ž

> Note: Installing a package globally may require administrative privileges. This means you have to use the `sudo` command for Unix-based systems or run a terminal with administrative privileges on Windows systems.

```sh
npm i -g create-resolve-app
create-resolve-app my-resolve-app
cd my-resolve-app
npm run dev
```

![Terminal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15689049/29822549-8513584c-8cd4-11e7-8b65-b88fdad7e4d1.png)

After that, your app (the `http://localhost:3000/` URL) opens in the default browser.

## **Getting Started**
### Create an App

Create a new reSolve application in one of the following ways:

* `yarn`:
    ```sh
    yarn create resolve-app my-resolve-app
    ```

* `npx`:
    ```sh
    npx create-resolve-app my-resolve-app
    ```

* `npm`:
    ```bash
    npm i -g create-resolve-app
    create-resolve-app my-resolve-app
    ```

This creates the `my-resolve-app` directory in the current directory and places your new app into it.

### Available Scripts ðŸ“‹

#### Run in the Development Mode

Once the installation completes, you can start your app by running `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` in your application directory.

This runs the app in the development mode.
Open the http://localhost:3000 URL to view it in your default browser.
 
The page reloads as you edit source code files.
All errors appear in the console.
 
#### Build and Optimize for Production

The `npm run build` or `yarn build` command builds the client and server bundles for production using Webpack.
 
Building is performed in the `NODE_ENV === 'production'` [mode](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/#node-environment-variable), so the build is optimized. 

The HTTP server for the serving client bundle and assets is not included.

#### Run the App From the Build Directory

`npm start` or `yarn start`

#### Run Unit Tests with Jest

`npm test` or `yarn test`

#### Run Functional Tests with TestCafe

`npm run test:functional` or `yarn test:functional`
