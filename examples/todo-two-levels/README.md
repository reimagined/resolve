This example shows how to work with [View Models](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/View%20Model.md) in **all event subscription** cases. Sometimes, for example, for fast application prototyping, it's useful to have a View Model subscribed to all events. There's a **wildcard** feature for this shown in the example. Get it using this command:

```sh
npx create-resolve-app resolve-two-levels-todo-example -e todo-two-levels
```
