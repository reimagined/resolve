# **Todo Two Levels Example**

## How to start?

This example demonstrates how to work with view-models in the **all events subscribtion** case. Sometimes, for example for fast application prototyping, it's necessary to have view-model on client with all server events instead of part. There's a special feature called **wildcard**, that allows to subscribe to all events. To setup:

```bash
npx create-resolve-app todo-two-levels-example -e todo-two-levels
```
