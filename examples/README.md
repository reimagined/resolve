# Examples

## Installation

You can get a sample app using the `create-resolve-app` tool with the `-e` flag followed by an example name:

```sh
npx create-resolve-app resolve-todo-example -e todo
```

Use the `create-resolve-app -h` command to list the available examples.

The created application is accessible using the `http://localhost:3000/` and `http://<your_ip>:3000` URLs (you can change this in [resolve.config.json](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/packages/resolve-scripts/configs/resolve.config.json)).

You can also use `npm` or `yarn` instead of `npx`:

```sh
yarn create resolve-app resolve-todo-example -e todo
```

or

```sh
npm i -g create-resolve-app
create-resolve-app resolve-todo-example -e todo
```
