This is a simple application that demonstrates how to use sagas. Saga listens to events and can issue commands based on its state and custom logic. You can think of it as of a virtual programmatic user.

## How to Start?

You can use `create-resolve-app` to install this example:

```bash
npx create-resolve-app resolve-with-saga-example -e with-saga
```
