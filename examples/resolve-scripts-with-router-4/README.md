# Example: React-router-4
**React-router-4** is a simple single page application (SPA) based on the Create ReSolve App. The application uses the **react-router (v4)** package to implement routing for server and client sides. This example shows how to add a router to a reSolve application and guarantee correct server-side rendering.

Refer to [https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy) to learn more about React Router v4. 

**Important note**: When configuring a router instance on the server side, ensure that it is wrapped in a component in the following way:
```
rootComponent: (props, context) =>
    <StaticRouter location={props.url} context={{}}>
        <RootComponent />
    </StaticRouter>
```

The current URL generated by server-side rendering is available at `props.url`.

You can manually handle redirects using `Helmet`. See [https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) for more information.
