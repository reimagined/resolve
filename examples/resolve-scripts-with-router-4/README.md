# Example: React-router-4
**React-router-4** is a simple single page application (SPA) which is based on Create ReSolve App. The app uses the **react-router (v4)** package to implement routing for server and client sides. The main goal of this example is to show how to add a router to a reSolve application and guarantee correct server-side rendering.

To learn more on React Router v4’s philosophy and technical details, refer to: [https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy)

**Important note**: when configuring a router instance on the server side, make sure that it is wrapped in a component in the following way:
```
rootComponent: (props, context) =>
    <StaticRouter location={props.url} context={{}}>
        <RootComponent />
    </StaticRouter>
```

The current URL generated by server-side rendering is available in `props.url`.

If required, you can manually handle redirects by using `Helmet` and rendering redirect headers inside it. Find more information here: [https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet).
