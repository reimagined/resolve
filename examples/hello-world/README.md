## How to start?

This is an empty app used as a template for new **reSolve** applications. The `create-resolve-app` script started without arguments creates this app:

```sh
npx create-resolve-app my-app
```
You can also create it using the example-creation syntax:

```sh
npx create-resolve-app resolve-hello-world-example -e hello-world
```
