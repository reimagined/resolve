## How to start?

It's a simple **empty reSolve application** that can be used like boilerplate. `create-resolve-app` package install this example like starting application by default, so you can setup this example by one of two ways:
1. Create a **new reSolve** application:
```bash
npx create-resolve-app my-app
```
2. Create a **reSolve example**:
```bash
npx create-resolve-app hello-world-example -e hello-world
```
