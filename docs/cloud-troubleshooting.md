## An application does not output any logs.

Make sure that you run your application with the correct debug levels.

Refer to the [debugging](debugging.md) topic for more information.

## An application works correctly on the local machine but does not run on the cloud.

Check the application's **config.cloud.js** configuration file. If your application does not run on the cloud, you may need to update this file after you changed the application's structure or updated the application to a new version of the reSolve framework.

## How to view deployment errors?

Use the `describe` command of the [reSolve Cloud CLI](cloud-cli.md). This command outputs the last error that occurred during the application's deployment.

```bash
resolve-cloud describe <deploymentId>
```
