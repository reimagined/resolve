**Read Side**

An application's read side handles events and answers data requests. The read side consists of the following blocks:

- Read models - updates a persistent state based on incoming events and use this state to build the queried data samples.
- View models - ephemeral read models that use WebSockets to synchronize their state with the client.
- Sagas - describe long-running processes as chains of events and side effects.
