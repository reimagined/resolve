**Aggregate**

An aggregate handles incomming commands and emits events that are then saved to the event store and propagate to the read side.

In terms of the event sourcing paradigm, an aggregate is a cluster of domain objects. An aggregate should be able to handle its commands without the need to communicate with other aggregates, which also makes it a transaction boundary.

An aggregate is defined as follows:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="commands" label="Command Handlers" default>

```js
// common/aggregates/my-aggregate.commands.js

const aggregate = {
  create: (state, { payload: { name } }) => {
    if (state.exists) {
      throw new Error('Aggregate already exists')
    }
    return {
      type: MY_AGGREGATE_CREATED,
      payload: { name },
    }
  },
  addItem: (state) => {
    if (!state.exists) {
      throw new Error('Aggregate does not exist')
    }
    return {
      type: MY_AGGREGATE_ITEM_ADDED,
      payload: { itemName: `Item ${state.items.length}` },
    }
  }
  ...
}
export default aggregate
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="projection" label="Projection">

```js
// common/aggregates/my-aggregate.projection.js

const projection = {
  Init: () => ({
    exists: false,
  }),
  [MY_AGGREGATE_CREATED]: (state) => ({
    ...state,
    exists: true,
    items: [],
  }),
  [MY_AGGREGATE_DELETED]: (state) => ({
    ...state,
    exists: false,
  }),
  [MY_AGGREGATE_ITEM_ADDED]: (state, { payload }) => ({
    ...state,
    items: [...state.items, payload.itemName],
  }),
  [MY_AGGREGATE_ITEM_REMOVED]: (state, { payload }) => ({
    ...state,
    items: state.items.filter((item) => item !== payload.itemName),
  }),
}
export default projection
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="config" label="App Config">

```js
// config.app.js

const appConfig = {
  aggregates: [
    {
      name: 'MyAggregate',
      commands: 'common/aggregates/my-aggregate.commands.js',
      projection: 'common/aggregates/my-aggregate.projection.js',
