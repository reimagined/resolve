**View Model**

View models are ephemeral Read Models that are queried based on aggregate ID. They have the following properties:

- View models are rebuilt on every request. They do not store persistent state and do not use the Read Model store.
- View models are queried based on aggregate ID and can maintain a WebSocket connection to push data updates to the client.
- View model projections are defined in a format that is isomorphic with Redux reducers so their code can also be used on the client side to define reducer logic.

Use view models in the following scenarios:

- To create aggregate-centric views that request relatively small portions of data based on aggregate IDs.
- To create reactive components, whose state is kept up-to date on the client.

A view model is defined as follows:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="projection" label="Projection" default>

```js
// common/view-models/my-aggregate-items.projection.js

import {
  MY_AGGREGATE_ITEM_ADDED,
  MY_AGGREGATE_ITEM_REMOVED,
} from '../event-types'
const projection = {
  Init: () => [],
  [MY_AGGREGATE_ITEM_ADDED]: (state, { payload: { itemName } }) => [
    ...state,
    itemName,
  ],
  [MY_AGGREGATE_ITEM_REMOVED]: (state, { payload: { itemName } }) =>
    state.filter((item) => item !== itemName),
}
export default projection
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="config" label="App Config">

```js
// config.app.js

const appConfig = {
  viewModels: [
    {
      name: 'MyAggregateItems',
      projection: 'common/view-models/my-aggregate-items.projection.js',
    },
  ],
  ...
}
export default appConfig

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
