#### Event Store Adapter

The event store adapter implements intermediate logic that defines how reSolve communicates with the underlying data storage. ReSolve is shipped with a set of event store adapters that provide support for differrent kinds of data storages. You can use different event store configutrations for different execution targets. For example, the code sample below demonstrates how to configure an event store adapter for the development machine:

```js
// config.dev.js

import { declareRuntimeEnv } from '@resolve-js/scripts'
const devConfig = {
  eventstoreAdapter: {
    module: '@resolve-js/eventstore-lite',
    options: {
      databaseFile: 'data/storage.db',
      secretsFile: 'data/secrets.db',
      snapshotBucketSize: 100,
    },
  }
  ...
}
export default devConfig
```
