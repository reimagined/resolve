**Q**: Where can I find information about CQRS and Event Sourcing?<br/>
**A**: Refer to the following resources:

**Q**: What is the difference between a Read Model and a View Model?<br/>
**A**: Read Models implement the standard event sourcing mechanisms.
View Models are a Redux-specific extension to these mechanisms. View models are reactive and use websockets to synchronize their state with the redux state on the client.

**Q**: How to implement a Read Model with direct access to the underlying store?<br/>
**A**: Implement a [custom Read Model](read-side.md#custom-read-models). Custom Read Models allow you to use custom logic to communicate with a Read Model store.

**Q**: How to send an aggregate command?<br/>
**A**: To send a command from a client browser, use the [standard HTTP API](frontend.md#http-api): <br/>

```
$ curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/commands"
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '
{
  "aggregateName":"Todo",
  "type":"createItem",
  "aggregateId":"root-id",
  "payload": {
    "id":`date +%s`,
    "text":"Learn reSolve API"
  }
}
```

On the server side, you can [send a command](api-reference.md#executecommand) from an API Handler or Saga:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

[mdis]:# (../tests/saga-sample/saga.js#execute)
```js
await sideEffects.executeCommand({
  aggregateName: 'User',
  aggregateId: event.aggregateId,
  type: 'requestConfirmUser',
  payload: event.payload
})
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

**Q**: How to perform validation to ensure input values are unique?<br/>
**A**: In a distributed application, it is not possible to perform reliable checks. You should detect value duplicates in a Read Model or Saga projection code and mark duplicated values as incorrect.

**Q**: How to implement a frontend?<br/>
**A**: There are three main approaches to frontend development in reSolve:

- Use one of the available client libraries. Refer to the [Frontend](frontend.md) article for more information.
- Use the [HTTP API](frontend.md#http-api) exposed by a reSolve application.
- Write your own wrappers for the reSolve HTTP API.
