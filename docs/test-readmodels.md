## Test API

The **resolve-testing-tools** package contains utilities that allow you to test Read Models and Sagas. The provided tools reproduce a Read Model's full lifecycle in the testing environment.

To write a test, call the `givenEvents` function. This function takes an array of events and gives access to a number of functions that you can chain together to describe the test case. The following functions are available:

| Function | Description |
|-- | --- |
| `readModel({ name, projection, resolvers, adapter })` | Runs a Read Model projection on the given events and provides access to the Read Model's resolver functions.<br>A resolver function returns a promise that resolves to the response object. |
| `as(jwtToken)` | Specifies a JWT used for authentication. |
| `saga({ handlers, sideEffects, adapter, name })` | Runs a Saga on the given events and provides access to a promise that resolves to an object containing information about the Saga's execution. |
| `properties(sagaProperties)` | Specifies Saga properties |


## Testing Read Models

The code sample below demonstrates a **jest** test for a Read Model:

```js
test('projection "SHOPPING_LIST_CREATED" should create a shopping list', async () => {
  const shoppingLists = await givenEvents([
    {
      aggregateId,
      type: SHOPPING_LIST_CREATED,
      payload: {
        name: 'Products'
      }
    }
  ])
    .readModel({
      name: 'ShoppingLists',
      projection,
      resolvers,
      adapter
    })
    .all()

  expect(shoppingLists[0]).toMatchObject({
    id: aggregateId,
    name: 'Products'
  })
})
```

In this example, the `.all` function called in the end of the call chain is the `ShoppingLists` Read Model's resolver function. It returns a promise that resolves to the resolver's response object.


## Testing Sagas

The code sample below demonstrates a **jest** test for a Saga:

```js
 test('success registration', async () => {
      const result = await givenEvents([
        {
          aggregateId: 'userId',
          type: 'USER_CREATED',
          payload: { mail: 'user@example.com' }
        },
        {
          aggregateId: 'userId',
          type: 'USER_CONFIRM_REQUESTED',
          payload: { mail: 'user@example.com' }
        },
        { aggregateId: 'userId', type: 'USER_CONFIRMED', payload: {} }
      ]).saga(sagaWithAdapter)

      expect(result).toMatchSnapshot()
    })
```

The `saga` function returns a promise that resolves to an object containing the following fields:

- `commands` - An array of commands generated by the Saga;
- `queries` - An array of queries performed by the Saga;
- `scheduleCommands` - An array of commands scheduled by the Saga;
- `sideEffects` - An array of side effects triggered by the Saga.
