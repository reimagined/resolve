## Testing Tools

The **resolve-testing-tools** package contains utilities that allow you to test Read Models and Sagas. The provided tools reproduce a Read Model's full lifecycle in the testing environment.

To write a test, call the `givenEvents` function. This function takes an array of events and gives access to a number of functions that you can chain together to describe the test case. The following functions are available:

| Function                                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `readModel({ name, projection, resolvers, adapter })` | Runs a Read Model projection on the given events and provides access to the Read Model's resolver functions.<br>A resolver function returns a promise that resolves to the response object. |
| `as(jwtToken)`                                        | Specifies a JWT used for authentication.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `saga({ handlers, sideEffects, adapter, name })`      | Runs a Saga on the given events and provides access to a promise that resolves to an object containing information about the Saga's execution.                                              |
| `properties(sagaProperties)`                          | Specifies Saga properties                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Testing Read Models

The code sample below demonstrates a **jest** test for a Read Model:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

[mdis]:# (../examples/shopping-list/test/unit/read_models.test.js#read-model-test)
```js
    test('projection "SHOPPING_LIST_CREATED" should create a shopping list', async () => {
      const shoppingLists = await givenEvents([
        {
          aggregateId,
          type: SHOPPING_LIST_CREATED,
          payload: {
            name: 'Products'
          }
        }
      ])
        .readModel({
          name: 'ShoppingLists',
          projection,
          resolvers,
          adapter
        })
        .all()

      expect(shoppingLists[0]).toMatchObject({
        id: aggregateId,
        name: 'Products'
      })
    })
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

In this example, the `.all` function called at the end of the call chain is the `ShoppingLists` Read Model's resolver function. It returns a promise that resolves to the resolver's response object.

## Testing Sagas

The code sample below demonstrates a **jest** test for a Saga:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

[mdis]:# (../tests/saga-sample/saga.test.js#saga-test)
```js
test('success registration', async () => {
  const result = await givenEvents([
    {
      aggregateId: 'userId',
      type: 'USER_CREATED',
      payload: { mail: 'user@example.com' }
    },
    {
      aggregateId: 'userId',
      type: 'USER_CONFIRM_REQUESTED',
      payload: { mail: 'user@example.com' }
    },
    { aggregateId: 'userId', type: 'USER_CONFIRMED', payload: {} }
  ])
    .saga(sagaWithAdapter)
    .properties({
      [RESOLVE_SIDE_EFFECTS_START_TIMESTAMP]: Number.MAX_VALUE
    })

  expect(result).toMatchSnapshot()
})
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

The `saga` function returns a promise that resolves to an object that contains the following fields:

- `commands` - An array of commands generated by the Saga;
- `queries` - An array of queries performed by the Saga;
- `scheduleCommands` - An array of commands scheduled by the Saga;
- `sideEffects` - An array of side effects triggered by the Saga.
