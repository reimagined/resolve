The reSolve Cloud platform's web GUI is available at [admin.resolve.sh](https://admin.resolve.sh). It allows you to browse and manage your reSolve application deployments and their resources including event storage data, domains and certificates, logs, performance traces, and information about your account's activity.

The web GUI's functionality mirrors the functionality of the CLI. For most tasks, you can choose one or the other.
