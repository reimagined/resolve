#Lesson 1 - Create a new reSolve application

You can create a new reSolve app using the create-resolve-app utility available on **npm**:

#####npm:
``` sh
npm i -g create-resolve-app
create-resolve-app shopping-list
```

#####npx:

``` sh
$ npx create-resolve-app shopping-list
```


#####yarn:

``` sh
$ yarn create resolve-app shopping-list
```

After this a minimal reSolve application is ready. You can run it in development mode by typing:

``` sh
$ yarn run dev
```
