## :rocket: Getting Started

### Installation

Make sure you have **NodeJS** version **8.10.0** or higher.

Use [create-resolve-app](packages/core/create-resolve-app) package to create a new reSolve application. The easiest way is to use [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx/v/1.1.1) ()

```sh
npx create-resolve-app my-awesome-app
cd my-awesome-app
npm run dev
```

<details>
<summary>You can also use npm or yarn tools</summary>

#### [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

> Note: Installing a package globally may require administrative privileges.

```sh
npm i -g create-resolve-app
create-resolve-app my-awesome-app
cd my-awesome-app
npm run dev
```

#### [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

```sh
yarn create resolve-app my-awesome-app
cd my-awesome-app
yarn run dev

</details>
<p></p>

Your application will be running at http://localhost:3000/.

### Creating a new app with a code example

There are several [code examples](./examples/) provided. You can add code from these examples into your projects. To list the available examples use the create-resolve-app -h command.

To create a new application with the code of the specific example use the create-resolve-app command with the -e flag followed by the example's name.

For instance, to run the [shopping-list example](./examples/shopping-list), run:

```sh
npx create-resolve-app resolve-example -e shopping-list
```
