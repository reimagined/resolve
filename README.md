## :rocket: Getting Started

### Installation

Make sure you have **NodeJS** version **8.10.0** or greater.

Use [create-resolve-app](packages/core/create-resolve-app) package to create a new reSolve application. The easiest way is to use [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx/v/1.1.1) ()

```sh
npx create-resolve-app my-awesome-app
cd my-awesome-app
npm run dev
```

<details>
<summary>You can also use npm or yarn tools</summary>

#### [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

> Note: Installing a package globally may require administrative privileges. That means you have to use the `sudo` prefix on Linux and MacOS, or start a terminal with the administrative privileges on Windows.

```sh
npm i -g create-resolve-app
create-resolve-app my-awesome-app
cd my-awesome-app
npm run dev
```

#### [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

```sh
yarn create resolve-app my-awesome-app
cd my-awesome-app
yarn run dev
```

</details>
<p></p>

Your application is running at http://localhost:3000/.

### Creating a new app with an example code

You can create a new application with an example code using `create-resolve-app` with the `-e` flag followed by an example name. Use the `create-resolve-app -h` command to list the available [examples](./examples/).

For instance, to run a [shopping-list](./examples/shopping-list) example, run:

```sh
npx create-resolve-app resolve-example -e shopping-list
```
