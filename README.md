### <a name="installation">Installation</a>

The [create-resolve-app](packages/create-resolve-app) package is used to create a **reSolve**-based application. You can use it to get one of the examples, or create an empty application. By default, `create-resolve-app` generates an empty [Hello World](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/tree/master/examples/hello-world) application. You can start working on your new **reSolve** application in just **2 minutes** using [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx/v/1.1.1)!

```sh
npx create-resolve-app my-awesome-app
cd my-awesome-app
npm run dev
```

The created application is accessible using the http://localhost:3000/ and `http://<your_ip>:3000/` URLs (you can [change the URL settings](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/API%20References.md)). Start learning **reSolve** with the [**ToDo List App Tutorial**](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/Tutorials/ToDo%20List%20App%20Tutorial.md) tutorial. Use the [**documentation**](#documentation), [**tutorials**](#tutorials) and [**examples**](#examples) to learn **reSolve** more deeply.

Instead of npx you can also use npm or yarn tools:

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

    > Note: Installing a package globally may require administrative privileges. That means you have to use the `sudo` prefix on Linux and MacOS, or start a terminal with the administrative privileges on Windows.

    ```sh
    npm i -g create-resolve-app
    create-resolve-app my-awesome-app
    cd my-awesome-app
    npm run dev
    ```

* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

    ```sh
    yarn create resolve-app my-awesome-app
    cd my-awesome-app
    yarn run dev
    ```

### <a name="examples">Examples</a>

You can get a sample app using the `create-resolve-app` tool with the `-e` flag followed by an example name. Use the `create-resolve-app -h` command to list the available [examples](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/tree/master/examples).

The following tools are used to get a sample **reSolve** application:

```sh
npx create-resolve-app todo-example -e todo
```

The created application is accessible using the http://localhost:3000/ and `http://<your_ip>:3000` URLs (you can [change your URL settings](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/API%20References.md)).

Instead of npx you can also use npm or yarn tools:

* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

    ```sh
    yarn create resolve-app todo-example -e todo
    ```

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

    ```sh
    npm i -g create-resolve-app
    create-resolve-app todo-example -e todo
    ```

## <a name="documentation">**📚 Documentation**</a>

You can develop and run **reSolve** applications on **Linux**, **Mac** and **Windows** operating systems. It is also possible to integrate **reSolve** with the **React Native**, but this approach is currently experimental.

The minimum supported **NodeJS** version is **8.0.0**.

**reSolve** supports [**npx**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx), [**yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/), and [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/).
