[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/reimagined/resolve.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/reimagined/resolve) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/create-resolve-app.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/create-resolve-app) [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reimagined/resolve/master/LICENSE)

A JavaScript framework for **CQRS**, **Domain-Driven Design** and **Event Sourcing** with support for **React** and **Redux**. **reSolve** provides a new way to describe an app's core logic and fully separate it from auxiliary code.

### <a name="installation">Installation</a>

The [create-resolve-app](packages/create-resolve-app) package is used to create a **reSolve**-based application. You can use it to get one of the examples, or create an empty application. By default, `create-resolve-app` generates an empty [Hello World](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/tree/master/examples/hello-world) application.

```sh
npx create-resolve-app my-awesome-app
cd my-awesome-app
npm run dev
```

The created application is accessible using the http://localhost:3000/ and `http://<your_ip>:3000/` URLs (you can [change the URL settings](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/API%20References.md)).

### <a name="examples">Examples</a>

You can get a sample app using the `create-resolve-app` tool with the `-e` flag followed by an example name. Use the `create-resolve-app -h` command to list the available examples.

The following tools are used to get a sample **reSolve** application:

```sh
npx create-resolve-app todo-example -e todo
```

The `create-resolve-app` can is capable of creating the following apps:

* [**hacker-news**](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/tree/master/examples/hacker-news)
* [**hello-world**](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/tree/master/examples/hello-world)
* [**todo**](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/tree/master/examples/todo)
* [**todo-two-levels**](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/tree/master/examples/todo-two-levels)
