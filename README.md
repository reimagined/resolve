[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/reimagined/resolve.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/reimagined/resolve) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/create-resolve-app.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/create-resolve-app) [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reimagined/resolve/master/LICENSE)

A JavaScript framework for **CQRS**, **Domain-Driven Design** and **Event Sourcing** with robust support for **React** and **Redux**. **reSolve** provides a new way to describe an app's core logic and fully separate it from auxiliary code.

## <a name="why-resolve">**üèóÔ∏è Why reSolve**</a>

With **reSolve** you can more efficiently create applications of any complexity level. A single approach is used for simple [ToDo List](#todo-list) and for a complex reactive application like Stack Overflow, with distributed architecture that is ready for high load. The technologies stack (CQRS, Event Sourcing, Domain-Driven Design, React + Redux) makes any **reSolve** application scalable and maintainable, so you can focus on business logic instead of auxiliary code.

### <a name="installation">Installation</a>

The [create-resolve-app](packages/create-resolve-app) package is used to create a **reSolve**-based application. You can use it to get one of the examples, or create an empty application. By default, `create-resolve-app` generates an empty [Hello World](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/tree/master/examples/hello-world) application. You can start working on your new **reSolve** application in just<!--sic--> **2 minutes**!

Use one of these tools to start a new **reSolve** aplication:

* [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx)

    ```sh
    npx create-resolve-app my-awesome-app
    cd my-awesome-app
    npm run dev
    ```

* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

    ```sh
    yarn create resolve-app my-awesome-app
    cd my-awesome-app
    yarn run dev
    ```

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

    ```sh
    npm i -g create-resolve-app
    create-resolve-app my-awesome-app
    cd my-awesome-app
    npm run dev
    ```

    > Note: Installing a package globally (the first command) may require administrative privileges. That means you have to use the `sudo` prefix on Linux and MacOS, or start a terminal with the administrative privileges on Windows.

The created application is accessible using the http://localhost:3000/ and `http://<your_ip>:3000/` URLs (you can [change the URL settings](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/API%20References.md)). Start learning **reSolve** with the [**First Application From Scratch**](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/Tutorials/First%20Application%20From%20Scratch.md) tutorial. Use the [**documentation**](#documentation), [**tutorials**](#tutorials) and [**examples**](#examples) to learn **reSolve** more deeply.

### <a name="tutorials">Tutorials</a>

* [First Application From Scratch](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/Tutorials/First%20Application%20From%20Scratch.md)
* [ToDo List App Tutorial](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/Tutorials/ToDo%20List%20App%20Tutorial.md)

### <a name="examples">Examples</a>

You can get a sample app using the `create-resolve-app` tool with the `-e` flag followed by an example name. Use the `create-resolve-app -h` command to list the available examples.

The following tools are used to get a sample **reSolve** application:

* [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx)

    ```sh
    npx create-resolve-app todo-example -e todo
    ```

* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

    ```sh
    yarn create resolve-app todo-example -e todo
    ```

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

    ```sh
    npm i -g create-resolve-app
    create-resolve-app todo-example -e todo
    ```

The created application is accessible using the http://localhost:3000/ and `http://<your_ip>:3000` URLs (you can [change your URL settings](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/API%20References.md)).

The `create-resolve-app` can is capable of creating the following apps:

* [**hacker-news**](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/tree/master/examples/hacker-news)

    This example demonstrates a Hacker News application similar to [YCombinator Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). The app's creation process is detailed in the [Hacker News Tutorial](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/Tutorials/Hacker%20News%20Tutorial.md).

* [**hello-world**](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/tree/master/examples/hello-world)

    An empty app that can be used as a template for any **reSolve** application (created by default).

* [**todo**](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/tree/master/examples/todo)

    This example demonstrates how to work with the [view-models](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/View%20Model.md). The app's creation process is detailed in the [ToDo List App Tutorial](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/Tutorials/ToDo%20List%20App%20Tutorial.md).

* [**todo-two-levels**](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/tree/master/examples/todo-two-levels)

    This example demonstrates how to work with view-models in the **all events subscribtion** case. Learn more about this case in the [View Model](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/View%20Model.md) article.

* [**top-list**](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/tree/master/examples/top-list)

    This example demonstrates how to update the application state on external events unrelated to user actions.

* [**with-authentication**](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/tree/master/examples/with-authentication)

    This example demonstrates how to add an authentication to an application using the [resolve-auth package](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/packages/resolve-auth/README.md).

* [**with-styled-components**](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/tree/master/examples/with-styled-components)

    This example demonstrates how to add the 'styled-components' library to an application.

## <a name="documentation">**üìö Documentation**</a>

### <a name="compatibility">Compatibility</a>

You can develop and run **reSolve** applications on **Linux**, **Mac** and **Windows** operating systems. It is also possible to integrate **reSolve** with the **React Native**, but this approach is currently experimental.

The minimum supported **NodeJS** version is **6.0.0**.

**reSolve** supports [**npx**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx), [**yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/), and [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/) package managers.
